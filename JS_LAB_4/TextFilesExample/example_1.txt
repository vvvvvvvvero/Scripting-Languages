The Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 project has just discovered an object similar to Jupiter
that has some of the reddest “colors” we've ever seen for such objects.
Astronomers use the word “color” in a special way, that aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
since they often look at wavelengths of light that are not visible to humans.
But in general, red “color” means that the object9 is brighter at longer wavelengths
and dim at shorter wavelengths. And this object really stands out!
